	Abstract = {Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and copy number alteration (CNA) feature
	prominently in the somatic genomic landscape of tumors. As such,
	karyotypic aberrations in cancer genomes have been studied extensively
	to discover novel oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes. Advances
	in sequencing technology have enabled the cost-effective detection
	of tumor genome and transcriptome mutation events at single-base-pair
	resolution; however, computational methods for predicting segmental
	regions of LOH in this context are not yet fully explored. Consequently,
	whole transcriptome, nucleotide-level resolution analysis of monoallelic
	expression patterns associated with LOH has not yet been undertaken
	in cancer. We developed a novel approach for inference of LOH from
	paired tumor/normal sequence data and applied it to a cohort of 23
	triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) genomes. Following extensive
	benchmarking experiments, we describe the nucleotide-resolution landscape
	of LOH in TNBC and assess the consequent effect of LOH on the transcriptomes
	of these tumors using RNA-seq-derived measurements of allele-specific
	expression. We show that the majority of monoallelic expression in
	the transcriptomes of triple-negative breast cancer can be explained
	by genomic regions of LOH and establish an upper bound for monoallelic
	expression that may be explained by other tumor-specific modifications
	such as epigenetics or mutations. Monoallelically expressed genes
	associated with LOH reveal that cell cycle, homologous recombination
	and actin-cytoskeletal functions are putatively disrupted by LOH
	in TNBC. Finally, we show how inference of LOH can be used to interpret
	allele frequencies of somatic mutations and postulate on temporal
	ordering of mutations in the evolutionary history of these tumors.},

abstract = {The evolution of cancer genomes within a single tumor creates mixed cell populations with divergent somatic mutational landscapes. Inference of tumor subpopulations has been disproportionately focused on the assessment of somatic point mutations, whereas computational methods targeting evolutionary dynamics of copy number alterations (CNA) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in whole-genome sequencing data remain underdeveloped. We present a novel probabilistic model, TITAN, to infer CNA and LOH events while accounting for mixtures of cell populations, thereby estimating the proportion of cells harboring each event. We evaluate TITAN on idealized mixtures, simulating clonal populations from whole-genome sequences taken from genomically heterogeneous ovarian tumor sites collected from the same patient. In addition, we show in 23 whole genomes of breast tumors that the inference of CNA and LOH using TITAN critically informs population structure and the nature of the evolving cancer genome. Finally, we experimentally validated subclonal predictions using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and single-cell sequencing from an ovarian cancer patient sample, thereby recapitulating the key modeling assumptions of TITAN.},
